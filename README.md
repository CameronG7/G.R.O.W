  ## Installation
  This application was build using Node.js, with a number of dependencies and devDependencies, all of which are listed in the package.json files. Once the repository has been cloned, run "npm i" from the root folder in order to download all of the project's dependencies. This function will concurrently cd into each of the client and server folders and run npm i within those, enabling the download of all requirements using one function.

  ## Usage
  This web application is very intuitive to use and navigate around. Upon hitting the home page, create an account by signing up using the button in the top right-hand corner. Once you have signed up, you can use this log in for future use. Use the search tab for searching for plants to add to your garden. Once you have added a few plants to your garden, navigate to the "See Your Plants" page, which will give you more granular data on the plants you have in terms of how often to water them, as well as how much sunlight to give them. You also have the ability to remove a plant from your garden by clicking the "Remove Plant" button under each of the plants.
